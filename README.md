The bitstream for Super Mario Bros. should already be generated.
To run it, open Vitis using what is in nes_usb as the workspace. For the platform file, select super_mario_big.

After building and running, the keyboard will start working after a few seconds and the game can be played normally.
The keys are as follows, WASD for directions, 
y: A, h: B, c: Select, v:Start.
